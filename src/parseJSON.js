// this is what you would do if you were one to do things the easy way:

  //check first character
  //if first char is {
    //result = {}

  //else if first char is [
    //result = []
    //json = json - firstchar and -lastchard// '["one", "two"]'.slice(1, json.length-1) --> '"one", "two"'.split(', ') --> ["one", "two"]

  //else if first char is "

  //else if Number(json) !== NaN

  //else if json === "true" or "false"
